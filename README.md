# OtterBall

A Monkey Ball like 3D platformer where you play an otter trying to get through a treacherous path with curves and obstacles. Collect the collectibles, avoid the dangers, keep on the road and be as fast as you can !

4 levels available.

Be careful of the physics ! Also, you may find some shortcuts along the way if you're fast enough...

Made for the KMU 1st semester Game Basics class in a group of 4 people using Unity.
